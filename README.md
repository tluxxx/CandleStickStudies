# CandleStickStudies
In this repository I will collect some studies on candle-stick patterns. The principal content of the notebooks is as follows: 
* CandleStickStudies_Libraries: Here I give instructions how to install TA-Lib and how to use it in principal in the Colab-Envirnoment
* CandleStickStudies_01: Statistical analyses of unfiltered candlestick pattern signals, comparison of unfiltered candlestick-pattern signals for entering positions with random entries.
