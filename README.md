# CandleStickStudies
In this repository I will collect some studies on candle-stick patterns. The principal content of the notebooks is as follows: 
* candlestick_studies_00_talib.ipynb:
  * In this noteboook we will demonstrate how to use the library TA-Lib to detect candlestick-patterns in stock data (using Colab).
  * see blog https://medium.com/@Tobi_Lux/using-ta-lib-for-detecting-candle-stick-patterns-in-stock-prices-04384dcbe8ab for details 
* candlestick_patters_01_predictive_power.ipynb:
  * Topics of the study are:
    * frequency of occurance of candlestick-patterns in real stock data (S&P-500 index from 2000 to mid 2024)
    * identification of the "most-active"-patterns (by highest number of occurences)
    * analyses of the development of cummulated return over time (1-20 days after occcurence of a pattern)
    * identification of the most profitable patterns
    * analysing distribution of returns over time, test for normality
    * comparison trading of most profitable candlestick patterns with trading, based on completely random entries; statistical tests of return distributions
  * The content of the notebook was published in the blog: https://medium.com/@Tobi_Lux/on-predictive-power-of-candlestick-patterns-in-stock-trading-an-experiment-d71dd92b4b27
